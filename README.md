## Hi there 👋

<!--
**# Immunology Data Analysis Project

## Description
This project focuses on applying data science techniques to analyze immunological datasets. 
The goal is to explore, visualize, and model biological data to extract meaningful insights.

## Objectives
- Learn and apply Python/R for biological data analysis  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on immune datasets  
- Build basic statistical and machine learning models  

## Data
The dataset used in this project comes from:
- Public repositories (e.g. GEO, Kaggle, ImmPort)
- Simulated immunology datasets for learning purposes

## Methods and Tools
- Programming: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)  
- Statistics: Descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing  
- Visualization: Boxplots, heatmaps, PCA  
- Domain: Immunology, flow cytometry, genomics ** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
